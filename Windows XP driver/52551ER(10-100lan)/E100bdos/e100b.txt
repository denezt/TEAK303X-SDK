INTRODUCTION
------------

The 82559ER/82551ER Fast Ethernet Controller is intended for embedded
designs. It is based on the GD82559 Fast Ethernet Controller that
has been extensively deployed in server, desktop, and mobile PCs.
The 82559ER/82551ER device is most suitable for applications that do not
require the advanced manageability features of the GD82559 as well
as WHQL certification.

The 82559ER/82551ER is a PCI device that consists of a 10BASE-T/
100BASE-TX Transceiver and an IEEE 802.3 Media Access Controller
integrated onto a single piece of silicon.  It is offered in a space-
saving thin BGA package measuring 15mm x 15mm.
